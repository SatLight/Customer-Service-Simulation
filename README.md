# Customer-Service-Simulation
Implemented in C by using Queues and Priority Queues

To make efficient customer service while providing priority to the customers whose needs are urgent.

There are 2 queues, busy and idle queue, which keep the count of busy and idle service men at all times. The admin enters the no. of service men they have, the time it takes to complete an event, customer id along with his priority and it assigns a serviceman to the task which has a higher priority. When the task is completed, the serviceman moves on to some other task if there is any.
